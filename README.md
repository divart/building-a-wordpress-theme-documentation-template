### Envato Tuts+ Course: Building a WordPress Theme Documentation Template
#### Instructor: [Adi Purdila](https://tutsplus.com/authors/adi-purdila)

Creating a good WordPress theme means more than just good aesthetics and well-written code. It must also be well documented, especially if you’ll be handing it over to your clients where they’ll be the ones installing and maintaining it.

Creating unique documentation for each WordPress theme is counter productive, so in this course I’ll show you how to plan, design and build a documentation template that you’ll be able to reuse on your WordPress themes.
